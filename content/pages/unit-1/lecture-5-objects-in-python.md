Check Yourself
--------------

What is mutability?

{{< div-with-class "reveal1">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle1">}}

A mutable object's values can be changed; we must be careful when working with mutable objects not to inadvertently change them.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is the important difference between a list and a tuple?

{{< div-with-class "reveal2">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle2">}}

Tuples are immutable (as are strings).

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What is cloning?

{{< div-with-class "reveal3">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle3">}}

Cloning creates a copy of a mutable object, so that the values can be manipulated without mutating the original object.

{{< /div-with-class >}}

What are the important aspects of a dictionary?

{{< div-with-class "reveal4">}}

› _View/hide answer_

{{< /div-with-class >}}{{< div-with-class "toggle4">}}

A dictionary is mutable, with immutable keys, and unordered.

{{< /div-with-class >}}
